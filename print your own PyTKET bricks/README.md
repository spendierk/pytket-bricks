# Making your own PyTKET Bricks set

Currently, you cannot buy these sets assembled but you can buy the bricks and tiles as well as print the needed stickers. 

The PyTKET bricks in the following kit can be arranged to represent all four Bell states in traditional and ZX-calculus representation. The Bell states are examples of qubit entanglement.

## Parts
You will need
- 23 white 2x2 bricks
- 23 white 2x2 tiles
- one Baseplate (about 6x6")
- stickers (The size of each sticker should be 0.62 by 0.62 inches.)

The table below contains a list of current stickers that I hope to expand over time.
