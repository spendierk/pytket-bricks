# Making your own PyTKET Bricks set

Currently, you cannot buy these sets assembled but you can buy the bricks and tiles as well as print the needed stickers. 

The PyTKET bricks in the following kit can be arranged to represent all four Bell states in traditional and ZX-calculus representation. The Bell states are examples of qubit entanglement.

## Parts
You will need
- 23 white 2x2 bricks, i.e. from Brick Owl [here](https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-brick-2-x-2-3003-6223).
- 23 white 2x2 tiles, i.e. from Brick Owl [here](https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-tile-2-x-2-with-groove-3068).
- one Baseplate (about 32x16), i.e. from Brick Owl [here](https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-baseplate-16-x-32-2748).
- print the Main Sticker Sheet below (The size of each sticker should be 0.62 by 0.62 inches.) You can print the stickes on a transparent/clear vinyl sticker sheet paper using a regular printer.

## Assembly
 1) Take the Main Sticker Sheet and cut along the marked yellow lines with scissors to obtain 23 stickers. 
 2) Place one tile on top of one brick.
 3) Stick one sticker on top of each tile.
 4) You are ready to use the PyTKET bricks to assemble your quantum circuit on the Baseplate.

## This kit contains the following PyTKET bricks with corresponding functions

## Example of First Bell State Assembly with ZX-calculus bricks
The PyTKET bricks in this kit can be arranged to represent all four Bell states, which are examples of qubit entanglement. Here we show an example of assembling the first Bell state using the ZX-alculus bricks with the corresponding wave function:
