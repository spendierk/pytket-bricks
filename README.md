#  pyTKET Bricks

The pyTKET bricks are a hands-on and fun way to familiarize yourself with well-known quantum circuits. Assemble the bricks to represent a Bell State or Grover's algorithm example. The brick color code and design is based on the pyTKET circuit rendering tool. PyTKET is the python wrapper of TKET, Quantinuum's open-source quantum SDK. 

We hope you enjoy pyTKET bricks by yourself, with friends, or with your family!
